# Interactive File Tree: Advanced Repository Visualization

## Feature Overview

The Interactive File Tree is a sophisticated, data-driven component designed to provide unparalleled insights into code repository structure, complexity, and evolution. By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques and real-time analytics, this feature transforms static file exploration into an intelligent, context-rich experience.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Database Schema (`convex/schema.ts`)**
   - Enhanced `files` table with comprehensive metadata
   - Tracked metrics:
     - Complexity scores (cyclomatic, cognitive)
     - File size and depth
     - Contributor ownership percentages
     - Last modified timestamps
   - `file_changes` table for granular modification tracking

2. **Data Access Layer (`convex/files.ts`)**
   - Optimized query methods for fast, efficient data retrieval
   - Key methods:
     ```typescript
     // Retrieve hierarchical file tree with advanced filtering
     getFileTree(options: FileTreeOptions): Promise<FileNode[]>
     
     // Analyze file modification patterns
     getChangeFrequencyStats(fileId: Id): Promise<ChangeFrequencyData>
     
     // Calculate file complexity and contributor insights
     analyzeFileComplexity(fileId: Id): Promise<ComplexityAnalysis>
     ```

3. **UI Components**
   - `FileExplorer`: Virtualized tree rendering
   - `ComplexityHeatmap`: Color-coded visualization
   - `FileDetails`: Comprehensive file analysis modal

### Complexity Analysis Algorithms

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Measures code paths and control flow complexity
- Calculated using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing
- Scoring range: 1-100, with higher scores indicating more complex logic

#### Cognitive Complexity
- Assesses code's cognitive load and readability
- Factors considered:
  - Nested control structures
  - Logical branching
  - Function call depth
- Provides insights beyond traditional metrics

### Ownership Visualization

- **Contributor Tracking**
  - Percentage-based ownership calculation
  - Time-based contribution analysis
  - Visual representation of team dynamics

### Performance Optimizations

- **Virtual Scrolling**
  - Efficient rendering for large repositories
  - Lazy loading of file tree nodes
  - Minimal memory footprint

- **Efficient Querying**
  - Convex real-time subscriptions
  - Indexed database queries
  - Memoized computation of complex metrics

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Code Review Preparation**
   - Quickly identify complex, high-risk files
   - Understand contributor ownership before reviews

2. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Visualize complexity hotspots
   - Prioritize refactoring efforts

3. **Team Collaboration Insights**
   - Understand file ownership distribution
   - Identify knowledge silos

4. **Onboarding and Knowledge Transfer**
   - New team members can rapidly understand repository structure
   - Visual exploration of codebase evolution
